Gatwick airport might market itself as being attached to London,
but it is actually just as close to Brighton on the south coast.
And since Brighton was my destination, that was a good thing.

A half-hour by train and I was there,
in a big train station in the classic English style,
with a glass roof curving over the trains.

The station is in the heart of town,
and I had researched the route to my accomodation
(in the tourist district along the shore) to be around a 20 minute walk.
There were helpful tourist information signs, every few blocks,
with “You are here” maps and local landmarks noted,
so I opted for a slightly different route that took me buy some of the big fancy buildings on the map.

It turns out that most of what I saw along that street was construction scaffolding,
but oh well.
November isn't exactly high tourist season:
it makes sense that this is when they do repairs!

I'd received text messages from the guest house owners
while I was busy at Gatwick fighting with internet and mobile connections.
They would be out that afternoon,
but there was a passcode for the front door
and they told me which room to use and where to find my key when I got there.

This could have been a disaster
(as I mentioned to the owner when I met her the next morning).
The messages were sent to my Canadian phone number,
since that was all they had on file.
But if I hadn't had a dual-SIM phone,
or if I was still on a prepaid plan at home with no roaming support,
I wouldn't have got those messages.

But let's not worry about disasters that didn't happen.
I got to the house and got in no problem,
and made my way up to the room waiting for me.

The Kempfield Guest House is a nice but unfussy B&B,
half a block from the seashore
in an old Georgian townhouse with posh checkerboard floors in the entryway
but slightly worn carpets upstairs.
My £49/night single room was at the back of the house on the second floor
(by British counting; third floor for North Americans—two flights up however you count it).

The room would have been small even before they carved out spaced for the ensuite toilet and shower.
As it was, the room is just a hallway leading up to a bed and a window.
But it was furnished with the essentials and some nice touches like complementary bottled water and cookies next to the tea and coffee,
and welcome chocolates with the towels on the bed.
Both bed and chocolate were welcome at this point.

My friend [Pedro Tavares](https://mobile.twitter.com/dipscom/) was driving into Brighton for the evening;
we were going to do some exploring before heading to the [Async JS meetup]().

Some time in between when I'd arrived at the guest house
and when Pedro sorted out his parking and met me, it started to rain.
And by rain, I mean pour.
It periodically tapered off, just enough to make you think it might be ending,
but then came down again harder then ever.

But we had nothing else to do, so we bundled up and headed off.

First stop: the famous old Brighton pier,
glowing with multi-colored lights in the wet darkness.
We walked out through the central arcade
(arcade in both the old meaning of a long sheltered passageway
and in the modern sense of a room full of flashing, noise-making coin-operated games)
and then nearly got blown over when we stepped out onto the open dock.

The rain flying sideways was definitely helping combat jetlag,
but it did discourage most photo-taking on this exploration.
I was also disappointed to discover that
I'd failed in my efforts to waterproof my fall boots prior to this trip.
I'd carefully oiled the leather, but hadn't checked the soles!
A crack in one was letting the puddles in,
soaking the leather from the inside out.

From the pier we wandered over to The Lanes,
a neighbourhood of helter-skelter narrow streets full of interesting shops,
and continued up & down and around that section of Brighton,
stopping periodically to double-check the tourist information maps
or our phones to confirm where we were.

The city seemed busy and bustling despit the blustery Wednesday evening.
But then, rain and wind and bluster is fairly standard for Brighton—especially in November.
And my only real complaints were the leak in my boot
and the unbalanced weight of my (mostly unpacked save for a laptop and essentials) backpack on my shoulders.

After all, it was better than -10°C and snow!
