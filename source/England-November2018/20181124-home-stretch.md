I woke up fairly early this morning.
Having that heater wake up early on its own
made this a much more pleasant experience.
Why hadn't Rhoda mentioned this feature sooner?

Breakfast was french toast,
to use up some eggs and milk and old bread.
Then a little bit of lazy catching up on this and that,
washed up the dishes from this morning and last night,
and still ready to go outside by 9am.

No surprises in the weed hatch this morning,
just a quick check and then start it up and ready to go.
It's a grey day, and slightly breezy,
but it was already 7°C
and the forecast said that it wasn't likely to get any warmer.

The canal heading east from Weedon is well populated —
boats lining the sides.
Farther on, some of those boats are attached to
very large canal-side homes.
I passed quite a few boats coming my way, but all without incident.
Some of them were nowhere near bridges, bends, or reedy patches.

The clouds turned to rain about a half hour into my trip.
“Morning — good or otherwise,” I called jokingly
to an oncoming boater who was busy trying to get his rain hood up.

But the rain didn't last,
and it went back to being a medium gray day.
Neither bright nor dark, neither warm nor frigid.

For a little variety,
I switched from crossing paths with other canal boaters
to crossing paths with kayaks.
Based on the advertising text on the grey two-person kayaks,
the pairs of teenagers paddling along the canal
were on a Saturday morning class.

I'd been planning on mooring up for a break
near the village of Nether Heyford.
But the mooring spot marked in my book
didn't have matching signs on the shore.
I went around the bend looking for the designated public mooring
only to find that the canal there was too narrow to moor safely
since there was private mooring on the opposite bank.
By the time I reached another place where I could tie up,
it would have been a good five minute walk back to the bridge
even before I could start walking up to the village.

Since it was still only 11, I decided to keep going to the next village.
I didn't have any particular interest in one or the other,
it was just an excuse to take a break and look around.
At Bugbrooke, the public mooring was impossible to miss.
It was also fully packed with other boats.
I continued on to the end of the row
and pulled over.

The section where I was had concrete reinforcing walls,
with no mooring rings or posts.
I'd need to pound some stakes into the earth to tie up.
Which isn't something we'd had to do that often on this trip.
Most designated areas had rings, and
more recently reinforced areas of the canal use a metal fencing structure
that you can easily tie to at any point using standard clips (which we had).

I had a hard time getting the stake for the front of the boat
hammered in to the packed dirt beyond the concrete wall.
But I was only going to be here a couple hours:
it didn't need to be perfect.

I swapped my muddy rain jacket for my blue tweed blazer,
grabbed my handbag (just in case),
and headed back up the path and into the village.

(My leather jacket has metamorphosized into a sewing project —
it's shoulder was damaged even more than mine
from carrying around that over-stuffed backpack!)

Bugbrooke is a nice looking place,
with a mix of old and new, small and large houses,
and a few independent shops.
The “Pantry Door” shop advertising fresh bread and local cheese
might have wooed me indoors if it weren't for the fact
that I'm trying to _empty_ my fridge and cupboard by tomorrow.

The loop around the village and back took close to 45 minutes.
Walking back up the towpath, I was a bit out of breath
and looking forward to a sit down for lunch.
Coming around the final bend, though:
“Oh, _no!_”

The Cotonwood was drifting lazily
with its nose pointed out into the canal,
only attached to the shore at the back.
So much for “it'll only be a few hours.”

I used the rope that was secured
to pull the stern of boat close enough to hop on,
and grabbed my boat hook and the mallet.
Using the hook, I pulled the boat back tight against the shore,
and then fished my front rope
(and the mooring stake it was still tied to)
out of the water.

I considered just pulling up and pushing off to stop somewhere else,
but I was tired and hungry
and knew I'd be likely to make even more stupid mistakes in that state.
I needed to secure the boat long enough for lunch.

Pulling everything tight again,
I managed to discover a small hole in the dirt that I'd missed before,
where some previous boater had done the hard work
to pound a stake deep into the shore.

As I ate lunch inside, it became clear what had happened.
Other boats coming around the bend
made the boat rock significantly,
first pulling at the ropes til they creaked,
then knocking against the wall.
A few rounds of that and a loose mooring pen would wiggle out of the earth.
Either that, or someone walking by had given it a kick.
(But I'd prefer not to assume malice without evidence.)

Of course, when I finished up my lunch and headed back out again,
I had a heck of a time getting the repositioned pin out of the ground.
I just can't win.

My plan was to get as close as possible to the marina today,
without going in.
I didn't want to pull in tonight and then have to get back out again tomorrow
for the pump-out and fuel-up services.

But I didn't know the area to know exactly how close I could park.
Was there room on the Northampton arm, just past the marina?
I didn't want to try it and then have to redo all the complicated turns.
With the skies dimming on an already gray day,
I planned to stop just before the turn off the main canal —
or more specifically, just before the bridge before the turn,
since my guidebook showed private mooring on the final section after that bridge.

It turned out to be a nice stretch of canal,
fairly wide and not too bendy.
There were other moored up boats spaced out along the tow-path side.
I passed one with a rather dejected-looking black and white dog
sitting on the towpath beside it,
head on their paws and despairing at the world.
A minute after I passed, I heard excited, puppy-like yapping.
I turned around to see the same old dog jumping and wagging
because a white-haired man had emerged from the boat to take a walk with them.

I did have to use the mooring stakes again to tie up —
the bank had metal reinforcing, but not the easy-clip type —
but the ground was a little softer here,
so they were easier to drive in.
To be extra sure, though,
I tied up the mid-boat rope as well as the front and the back.

Although my weather app had shown the temperature holding steady,
the damp and breeze seemed to have picked up over the afternoon
and I was rather cold as I went inside the boat.
I looked at that troublesome little iron stove,
but decided against trying to coax any heat from coal tonight.
I turned on the radiators.

Then I swept out and wiped off the cold stove,
as a start on my final clean-up of the boat.
I made sure, first, to change into the sweater
that was already covered with soot stains.

Still cold and tired, I tried out the small bathtub for a soak.
Not the most relaxing bath imaginable —
the corner tub is only around 4 feet (1.2m) long —
but I stayed in it long enough for
the diesel heater to replenish the hot water supply
so I could rinse off and wash my hair.

I headed to the kitchen next,
to see what I could make from my remaining food.
I'd been meaning for a while to make rice pudding
so I started with that.
I dumped all the rice I had into a pot,
looked at the quantity — twice what I'd ususally use —
but shrugged.
Had to use it up, and I also had more than enough milk.

Now, I make rice pudding all the time at home to use up milk
that's creeping up to its best-before date.
But I have an electric stove at home, not gas.
I found it difficult to keep the pot simmering at a low enough temperature,
and had to turn it off and on a few times.

I also have sugar at home.
I didn't have any on the boat.
Rhoda had been sweetening her coffee from a collection of sugar packets
(acquired over many months' visits to coffee shops),
but she'd taken the last of them with her.
But, I had in the freezer half a container of salted-caramel ice cream
that was horribly sweet,
so my plan was to mix some of that in with the cooked rice
as extra cream, sweetener, and flavouring.

While the rice was cooking,
I took stock of the rest of my food supplies
to plan my supper menu.
Lots of potatoes, an onion, some other vegetables,
a little leftover cooked chicken,
some cheese and butter,
and still plenty of milk.

I decided on a scalloped potato casserole.
I could make enough for lunch tomorrow, too.

I filled up a baking dish with what, I realize as I finish,
was enough food for four meals, not two.
I gave it a head-start cooking in the microwave,
but switched to the compact gas oven.
Again, kind of guessing about the temperature setting —
gas mark numbers mean nothing to me.

I should mention here, because it's very relevant to this story,
that I hate the idea of wasting food.
Like: the thought of throwing out edible food makes me physically anxious.
But that's exactly what I'd have to do with any leftovers tomorrow.
If I couldn't eat it or take it home with me,
I had to get rid of it somehow.
No open packages to be left on the boat,
and definitely nothing perishable.
So this urge to use it or loose it
was driving my cooking plans.

But as I looked at the huge dish of potato casserole,
and the huge pot of rice pudding,
I realized that wasting food was exactly what I'd done.
I _could_ have bagged up some of the food and walked up the towpath,
knocked on the door of another boat,
seen if the man with the black-and-white dog wanted
potatoes, rice, and half a jug of milk.

Heck, the packet of rice I could have just taped up and put in my suitcase
(along with all the cookies and candies
that I was already planning to take home,
and the buns, crackers, fruit and chopped veggies
that would be my airplane food).

What's worse, I was now not really feeling like eating much of anything.
I'd been standing in front of a hot stove and oven,
so my face and middle were hot and flushed,
but my damp hair and the cold floor meant that the head and feet were very cold,
and that kind of temperature differential
is an almost guaranteed queasy stomach for me.
All the nervous worrying about the cooking and cleaning and organizing
I needed to do before leaving tomorrow was definitely not helping.

The potatoes were still far from cooked,
but the rice seemed about ready
(after mixing in some egg and a few scoops of the caramel ice cream,
then letting it warm through),
so I decided to swap dinner and dessert.
I spooned myself out a bowl of the pudding
and sat down to try to settle my stomach.

It was horrible.

The rice was still very much <i lang="it">al dente</i>,
not soft and smooth like a pudding should be.
And the ice cream had imparted a very artificial caramel flavour to the mixture,
without substantially sweetening it.

I'm tired, I'm cold (except where I'm flushed),
I'm feeling queasy-sick,
and now I've got half my brain telling the other half
how completely I've messed up.

But I should eat something.

I review all my food,
trying to find something that doesn't make my stomach churn at a glance.
Fruit. I should eat some fruit.
I grab a plum, take a bite, gag.

I carefully cut away and eat the half of the plum that _isn't_ rotten,
and decide to call it a night.
I spoon the caramel-scented rice porridge back into the pot.
I'll clean it up tomorrow.
I turn off the oven,
and set my half-cooked casserole to cool on the top step of the entry ladder,
right under the air vent that lets in all the drafts.
I'd decide tomorrow whether I could eat any of it for lunch.

Tonight, I'm going to bed.
