Sunday morning I woke before dawn
to the ominous sound of rain pelting against the steel roof of the boat.
I vowed never to trust the Windows Weather app again.
It had promised us a sunny day for boating.
Just like it had promised us a dry day yesterday.
Two promised broken.

But by the time the sun and I both got out of bed,
the rain had eased up
and breaks in the cloud appeared as they shuffled across the sky.
This might not be acceptable cruising weather, after all.

And yes, that's what we'd be doing: cruising.
At least, that's what canal-boaters call it.
You can't say sailing, after all.
Canal boats don't have sails, they have motors.
But “motoring” is British for driving an automobile,
so you can't say that, either.
So cruising it is,
although I find the words
“puttering”, “chugging”, and even just “floating”
to be more descriptive of the pace of canal boat travel.

We had a bit of a lazy morning.
(we are on holiday, after all).
Both Rhoda and I also made use of the shower room at the marina.
There's a shower on board the boat,
but the water pressure and hot water supply are both limited.
The marina's hot, high-pressure shower
was appreciated enough by my still-sore shoulder
to make it worth the hassle of going out to enjoy it.

It was probably close to 11 by the time we turned on the motor
to head out on our journey.
Rhoda asked if I wanted to take first turn at the tiller (aka, driving the boat).
I looked out at the tightly packed marina —
boats all lined up in angle parking stalls —
with a some uncertainty.
I've driven a canal boat on two previous holidays,
but the most recent was two and a half years ago.
And I'd never tackled a maneuvre as complicated as this.

But I took the tiller,
knowing that a much more capable driver would be sitting beside me.

Exiting our stall in a straight line was no problem,
but turning turned out to be more complicated.
The steering mechanism works so that
you push the tail-end (stern) of the boat one way
and the front (bow) is supposed to swing in the other direction.

But instead of swinging around in place,
the entire boat was moving sideways.
A canal boat may not have a sail,
but that doesn't mean you can ignore the wind.
The stiff breeze that had us wrapped up in gloves and scarves
was also pushing against the long flat hull of the 58.5-foot (17.8m) boat.

Rhoda grabbed the tiller before I smashed into any of the other boats,
and managed to get the Cotonwood under control.
But even she got stuck
when we had to make an even tighter turn against the wind
in order to exit the marina.
The boat hook (a small hook on a long wooden pole)
was employed to un-wedge the stern end of the boat
so she could back up and try the turn again.

We had one more surprise when we met our first oncoming boat
just as we were about to pass under our first bridge.
Both our boat and theirs were coming around corners
so we didn't see each other
until we were both aiming for the same narrow passageway.
But the boats are never moving too fast
(full speed ahead is only around 5mph, aka 8km/hr),
and Rhoda was able to back up out of their way without too much trouble.

Safely through the bridge,
she handed the tiller back to me,
with the task to get us through Gayton junction.
The marina is on a branch of the Grand Union Canal that connects to Northampton
and the River Nene.
We were heading west on the Grand Union main line.
That meant another hard right turn,
but a much easier one than the turns in the marina,
with plenty of room to spare and the wind not so strong against us.

We met our second travelling boat of the day
in almost identical circumstance to the first,
heading for the same bridge channel —
except I was too close to the bridge to avoid it.
As I froze for a moment trying to decide whether or not
to hard reverse the engine,
Rhoda reached across me and pressed a switch I'd forgotten about,
and the boat let out a loud honk.

Of course. I have a horn. Good to know that.

Thankfully, the woman driving the other boat was clearly experienced,
and there was plenty of room in the canal bend on her side of the bridge,
so she was able to give me plenty of room to get through and away.


This section of the Grand Union canal is noted
for having 15 miles (24km) of clear cruising,
with neither lock nor lift-bridge
to force a boater to stop and get out.
The in order to avoid locks,
and keep the altitude of the canal level for that length,
the builders needed to wrap the canal around every hill and valley in the countryside.
Which means lots of bends and turns to practice your steering on.

I did pretty well — with the steering, that is —
until a section where the canal maintenance teams had let
the right bank grow into a waterfowl habitat of tall reeds and grass.

Although the canals were quiet,
I had been doing my best to keep to keep to my side of the canal.
Which is the right side, of course.
(Unlike those silly British drivers who keep on the not-right side of the road.)
So now I was trying to keep close to the reeds,
but not in them,
but in hindsight I was a little too worried about keeping the boat's nose out of the reeds,
and not enough worried about keeping it's propeller away from them.

When I did try to correct,
I found that I didn't have enough water to work with in the shallows by the reeds.
I tried to reverse and then correct when I had more room
I'd back up, get the stern of the boat out into the center of the canal,
then try to swing the bow into place by steering the stern to the side.
But in the end I'd find myself in the same place, tight against the reeds.

(As I mentioned earlier,
steering generally means rotating the boat around its middle.
So one end goes in the opposite direction than the other.)

The local waterfowl — a pair of swans —
seemed more confused than irritated about the mess I was making with their reeds.
They glided past me, then turned around to stare.

And of course another boat passed by while I'm in the midst of this back and forth.
On quiet days, boats only ever pass each other during awkward steering challenges,
don't you know.
But since I was already fairly tight against the side,
I just put the engine in neutral and waited for them to clear.

After a few more failed efforts to shift the boat sideways,
Rhoda took over and I switched to taking photos.

We continued on without much excitement,
to the fair-sized village of Wheedon Bec,
where we picked our mooring place based on its proximity to a Tesco grocery store for a few more supplies.

It was 3pm and we were much overdue for lunch.
But since it is November,
that late lunch was quickly followed by sunset,
and we were settling in for the night.
