title: Turning Around

I was awoken early Monday by winds jostling the boat,
making the ropes creak and moan.
With the bright floodlights of the Coventry canal basin
shining through the curtains,
I couldn't tell whether it was the middle of the night or just before dawn.
I checked my phone as I slipped into the toilet:
4:32am.
I put the eye mask back on and tried to get back to sleep.

The wind died down somewhat around the time the sun finally got up.
But I didn't get up for a while after that,
and still felt kind of groggy.
Rhoda wasn't much more bright eyed and bushy-tailed than I,
so we didn't get outside to start prepping the boat for departure
until after 9am.

The boaters moored opposite us were slightly earlier risers,
so we watched them back out into the basin and try to turn around.
The still-strong wind made the job difficult,
and one of the crew ended up pushing the nose of the boat along the dock
to finish the job.
Thankfully, we didn't need to do the same,
since Rhoda had turned us around before mooring yesterday.

And this was it: the farthest point of our journey.
From here on in we'll be retracing our path,
back to the marina at Gayton Junction.
Which is not to say that it'll be boring:
you see different things when facing in the opposite direction!
