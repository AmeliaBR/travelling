I was awoken early Monday by winds jostling the boat,
making the ropes creak and moan.
With the bright floodlights of the Coventry canal basin
shining through the curtains,
I couldn't tell whether it was the middle of the night or just before dawn.
I checked my phone as I slipped into the toilet:
4:32am.
I put the eye mask back on and tried to get back to sleep.

The wind died down somewhat around the time the sun finally got up.
But I didn't get up for a while after that,
and still felt kind of groggy.
Rhoda wasn't much more bright eyed and bushy-tailed than I,
so we didn't get outside to start prepping the boat for departure
until after 9am.

The boaters moored opposite us were slightly earlier risers,
so we watched them back out into the basin and try to turn around.
The still-strong wind made the job difficult,
and one of the crew ended up pushing the nose of the boat along the dock
to finish the job.
Thankfully, we didn't need to do the same,
since Rhoda had turned us around before mooring yesterday.

And this was it: the farthest point of our journey.
From here on in we'll be retracing our path,
back to the marina at Gayton Junction.
Which is not to say that it'll be boring:
you see different things when facing in the opposite direction!

Since I'd stayed inside for much of the drive in to Coventry,
I offered to take the tiller for the route out.
We were following along a ways behind our neighbours from the night before,
but at one point they pulled over.
When I called out to see if they were OK,
the man on the shore and the woman at the stern both answered in unison:
“Weed hatch!”

There was much more than weeds floating around in the urban canal,
ready to tangle a passing boat's propeller.
Among the less notable trash,
that black loveseat sofa was still where we passed it the day before.
Farther on, we passed a work crew boarding a small boat.

“Are you on sofa collection duty?” Rhoda asked, gesturing back behind us.
“No, we're heading off in this direction,” said the foreman, gesturing ahead.
Then: “Is there really a sofa back there?”

We almost had to stop and open our weed hatch ourselves.
Coming around a bend, we saw a man fishing from the canal bank.
That's not an unusual sight,
we've seen dozens and dozens of people fishing in both urban and rural canals.
And they're usually pretty good about pulling in their lines
in plenty of time to let a boat pass safely.
But after this man hurriedly pulled in his line,
he started rushing towards us:
he had _another_ fishing pole held in place by a bucket.
I couldn't stop before reaching the line,
so I put the boat in neutral — no propeller spinning —
as we floated over it.
It snagged a bit, but the man on the shore was able to shake it loose,
and we continued on, unsnared.

I took the boat as far as the junction,
turning us around the corners and into the Oxford canal.
Rhoda took over the tiller after she'd got us through the stop lock,
and I went inside to make lunch.
After I'd eaten, we swapped places,
and continued that way without stopping the boat
until we moored up at Newbold on Avon (just west of Rugby) for the evening.

I was at the tiller when we passed by Rose's Narrowboats.
I called out a “Good afternoon”
when I recognized a blue-overall'ed figure on the shore.
“She's running much better today,” I said.
“We'll see if it stays that way through the woods.”

“Well, if it doesn't, just give it the hard reverse,”
our friendly mechanic called back, miming the necessary action.

But the return journey only further convinced me that
our problem was more than just leaves clinging to the propeller.
The boat slowed to a crawl around the same bend as before,
which was hardly the leafiest section of water.
An unmistakable scraping sound could be heard off-and-on as we inched forward.
Shallow water, and probably branches or rocks underneath.

But now that we knew it wasn't our engine failing,
we could take it slow and steady and know we'd be through soon enough.

Slow and steady turned out to be the motto for the evening, too.

Our guidebooks mentioned that the Barley Mow pub and inn,
right beside the Newbold water point and visitor moorings,
had “facilities for boaters” including shower and laundry.
Consulting their website confirmed that this was still on offer:
you could rent one of their bathrooms by the hour,
and you could use their laundry room for a fee.
We were doing alright with our on-board shower,
but I still had a week left in my trip and needed more clean clothes.

After asking at the bar, and being directed to the propertier,
I was told they only had one set of machines, but they were currently free,
and mine for the low, low price of £5 each for wash and dry.
(Sigh. Same wince-inducing total price as at the Braunston marina.)
Go gather my things, and a bartender would show me my way.

I got my clothes, a few of Rhoda's,
and a magazine to keep me busy as I waited in the pub.
I didn't have to get _too_ dressed up this time:
the jeans I'd been altering to pass the time on my last laundry day
were now good enough to wear.
“See you in half an hour or so,” I called to Rhoda as I left.

The tiny storage room that housed the pub's washer and dryer
was a bit of a mess.
The young bartender made a show of being hospitable:
“Here you go, feel free to use our washing powder,
just select what you want on the machine —
well, you know how to use a washing machine, don't you?”
I eyed the many buttons, dials, and digital display.
“I'm sure I'll figure it out.”

There was a load of dish rags in the dryer,
but my guide assured me that they'd be gone by the time I needed it.
Then he left me to fill up the wash.

It was a tight squeeze for all the clothes I'd brought,
but it was the front-loading type of washing machine,
so it should toss them around evenly, I thought.
I picked out one of the many cycle options,
added an extra rinse to be sure,
then stared in confusion at the digital display.

2:53 it read.
Was that a clock? That had never been correctly set?
Surely that wasn't the countdown timer for a cycle.
3 minutes was much too short, and 3 hours seemed outrageously long.

I switched some of the settings,
and confirmed that the time displayed adjusted with them.
It _was_ a time estimate.
Three hours to wash a load of clothes, plus the dryer after it.
Damn these extra high-efficiency, water-saving, time-consuming machines!

There was a button for  “time saver” mode,
but I wasn't sure I trusted it to still clean a (very) full load of clothes.
Instead, I determined that if I switched to a warmer water temperature,
the time estimate was reduced to just over 2 hours.
I could live with that.
If anything, it made it seem like the time estimates
were actually based on real testing and evidence.
Of course it takes longer to get a good wash in luke-warm water.
(And I will say: the clothes were well cleaned in the end.)

Back in the pub, I stood around awkwardly for a minute or so
before deciding that I didn't want to spend more than three hours
sitting in the corner drinking by myself.
I went back to the boat for the two hours until the wash should be complete.

Back in the tiny laundry room,
I discovered that the dish rags still blocked my access to the dryer.
Before I could decide what to do with them,
the door pushed open behind me.
A young woman who turned out to be
the housekeeper for the inn side of the pub
was also checking on the status of the machines.

She wasn't particularly surprised to see me:
“Are you on a boat?” she asked.
But I was a complication in her work.
She was doing a weekly linen change for long-term inn guests,
and had run out of clean pillowcases and needed to do a load of washing.

Well, it was clear that the solution to both our problems
was to move the laundry along in the cycle,
so she took out and folded all the dish rags —
commenting repeatedly on their rancid smell,
and that this wasn't really her job to do.
I put my washing in the dryer and picked a cycle.
This machine didn't have a time estimate digital display, however.
I asked her how long it usually took.
“Well, I usually use the timed dry settings: 90 minutes.
Although I usually have to come back and put it on again after that.”

That wasn't very promising, but what could I do.
I started the machine, and got out of her way,
heading back to the pub.
I ordered a pint of cider and picked out a cozy corner
where I wouldn't look too anti-social reading on my phone.

After an hour, I went to check on the dryer.
The housekeeper was there, too,
checking on her load and, I think,
giving up on the idea that she'd get it done this evening.
My clothes were still very damp, but what was worse:
the lint filter was missing!
Wait, no, there it was: tumbled around with all my clothes.
I'd cleaned it out when I filled up the machine, of course,
and must not have snapped it firmly back in place.
Now the lint trap was jammed full of my socks and underpants.
I carefully reached in, pulled them out one by one,
shaking off as much lint as I could.
I resigned myself to the possibility that
a few items may have been lost forever,
sucked away into the main exhaust tube.

As I (firmly) put the lint filter back into place,
my companion commented: “Maybe it will dry a bit faster now.”
Maybe, indeed.
Good thing those British pints are so big:
I would be sipping that cider for a while yet.

At around 10:30pm,
the last remaining bartender turned off lights in the dining area.
(This also turned off the lights in the hallways to the toilets and the laundry room.
Good thing I'd brought a flashlight for walking along the dark canal!)
I checked on the clothes again,
then checked with her what time they'd be closing up completely: 11pm.
I waited as long as I could,
then went to clear my clothes from the machine.
It had just switched from “dry” to “cool down” according to the indicator lights,
and only a few items still felt slightly damp.
Good enough.

I folded everything up,
handed a ten-pound note to the bartender as I passed her by,
and headed back to the boat to lay out my clothes to finish drying completely.

It was a nice idea, to offer convenient laundry services to boaters.
And goodness knows, at the rates charged,
it's a good profit when you already have the machines sitting there.
But next time, I think I'll aim to use a more established laundrette
with commercial laundry machines.
