It was another windy night,
and just like on our previous night at Newbold,
our little vertical rubber bumpers were no help
against the corrugated retaining wall.
At least this time I knew what the sounds were,
and wasn't sleepily thinking that someone was jumping
on and off our boat.

According to forecasts,
today and tomorrow would be the coldest of our trip,
with lows near freezing and highs around 4 or 5°C.
(That's around 40°F for you Americans.)

We would be heading back across the Rugby section of the canal,
with two obstacles in our way:
the bridge construction crew with possible delays of up to an hour,
and then the Hillmorton locks.

First on the schedule, though,
was a quick excursion into Newbold for some milk and bottled water.
Rhoda had checked online that the Co-op food store was open,
and presumably had also double-checked its location.
We walked back up to the bridge,
around the pub and inn where I'd (eventually) done my laundry last night,
and continued on the main road up the hill.

Newbold may have once been an independent village,
but many of the houses had the feeling of modern suburb.
Not surprising considering how close it is to Rugby.
But it did have a lovely old square-towered church.
It took me a moment to realize that
the figure standing in the churchyard
was not a red-coated gardener, but a poppy-covered memorial.

Around the next bend, the houses seemed to be thinning out.
We passed an older gentleman waiting at a bus stop,
and Rhoda asked him if we were headed in the right direction
for the Co-op stores.
He looked confused.
“The Co-op? That's at the bottom of the hill.”

He gave a few more explicit directions,
and we turned around.
But since we'd already climbed this far,
Rhoda suggested we should take a closer look at
(and photographs of)
the old church and yard.

At the bottom of the hill,
our confusion was explained.
The main road through town makes a sharp bend,
and the bridge over the canal joins it just at that point.
We'd missed this three-direction intersection
by cutting through the parking lot of the pub
instead of going around the front.

A block and a half along the main road in the correct direction
took us to the shops.
From there, it wasn't much farther to the next bridge,
so we walked back along the tow-path from that side.

The walk reveled what had been hidden in the dark:
the canal at this point is raised up on a steep embankment,
a good 3 or 4 metres (10­-12 feet) above
backyards of a residential neighbourhood.

Back in the boat,
I put the groceries away and settle in for a second breakfast
while Rhoda starts up the engine and pulls away.

At one point, she slows down considerably,
right after passing under a pedestrian bridge.
A bright red narrowboat pulls by our windows.
“You do realize you're the only boat we've met today,”
she calls out in mock exasperation to the other driver, with a laugh.
After he's safely past
and she's safely lined up to head under the motorway overpass,
she opens the door to the cabin and explains to me:
“_Two_ bridges, on a bend, and who should we meet?”
An oncoming boat, of course.
That's how it always works.

I wash up the dishes,
keeping an eye out the window to track our progress.
The bridge construction crew are coming up soon.
I spot a few workers in orange overalls,
then the fences and signs marking the closed tow-path.
But at the bridge itself,
Rhoda keeps moving steadily,
and have barely enough time to grab a photo through a window
at the partially-constructed platform.
(Four large concrete spans were in place,
of what Rhoda estimated as around 25 total.)
After she passes, though,
a worker walks out behind her
to change the stop-go sign to stop.
Made it just in time.

I offered to take over the tiller and let Rhoda warm up,
but then pointed out that
the Hillmorton locks were “just around the next bend or two”
and maybe we should wait until we were through them before swapping.
Except I was misjudging our current location,
and it turned out to be at least 20 minutes worth of bends
that we both stood in the cold before I got off for the first lock.

These are the locks that have two parallel chambers at each step.
I headed to the one that was pretty much empty,
waving back at Rhoda to tell her which direction she'd need to go.
I just needed to open it up for her.

The first step is to open one sluice paddle to drain out any extra water
and remove any resistance when pushing open the gate.
The sluices in this case were part of the gate itself
(instead of being channels through the surrounding ground).
I went to crank it open,
but my L-shaped windlass couldn't do a full circle
without banging into the beam and handle.
I looked back at the boat floating in the middle of the wide canal section
with all our other windlasses on board.
Then I looked down again at the water level in the lock.
It _was_ pretty much empty
(meaning, the same water level as the canal on the lower side).
I gave the gate a bump, and it swung easily.
Okay, that wasn't too hard.

Then I scurried up to the top gate, crossed over,
and back to open up the gate on the other side.
Rhoda was already revving up the boat, aiming in.
But the gate jammed halfway open.
I looked down into the space where the gate was supposed to go but wouldn't.
A solid chunk of tree branch, a few inches in diameter,
was stuck across the space between wall and gate.
I shook the gate back and forth a bit,
and managed to loosen the log so that it at least floated parallel to the gate
and I could get it _almost_ fully open.
Rhoda and the boat were able to just squeeze through.

As I closed up the gates behind her
and opened the sluices on the top side,
I gave her two tasks:
fish out that branch with the boat hook,
and find me a shorter windlass.

She was able to do both.
For the second lock,
the only complication was the disappointing discovery that
the Canal Chef café we'd been thinking about for a warm lunch
had a “CLOSED until the 1st week of March” sign on the window.
We'd have to make our own warm lunch, I guess.

As she slowly floated upwards in the lock at the second step,
Rhoda's eyes were on the locks uphill.
Someone in a bright orange jacket was working them.
But were they going down or up?
Rhoda eventually confirmed that they were emptying the lock:
going down, and leaving a nice empty chamber for us to drive into.

“You won't need to close the gate here,” she said to me.
We would be leaving a nice, full chamber for them to drive into.

But when the person up ahead opened the now-empty lock,
we were confused to see no boat at all inside.
So much for that plan.
But was it just a friendly neighbour emptying the lock for us,
or what else was going on.

I closed up the second-step lock as Rhoda drove out,
and then walked up ahead to talk to the person in the orange jacket.
When I arrived, he was taking photographs of the gate and lock walls.
Not in a tourist-y way, but in an official inspection way.

However, when I asked, he said that we were free to use the lock,
he'd done all he needed.
So I turned around to wave Rhoda forward,
only to discover that she'd gotten herself jammed sideways
as she was floating around waiting for us.

The lock inspector started to walk down to give her bow-end
a push off from the bank,
but she got control and turned around.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the lock,
a boat that _was_ headed down the steps had arrived,
and pulled over to the side to wait for us.
So when we opened the top gate on the full lock,
I hopped on board the Cotonwood
(no need to close up when they were driving in right after)
and Rhoda and I motored off.

We weren't planning on going far —
Rhoda was very chilly by now,
so we were going to moor up and have a warm lunch.
But even if we wanted to keep moving, it wasn't an option.
As we tried to pull over,
a loud clunk-clunk-clunk sound came from below.
Reversing the engine didn't fix it.
I used the boat hook to help pull us in to shore,
and we tied up.

I'd been planning to have warm lunch first,
clear out the weed hatch second,
but Rhoda was already opening things up and stripping off her bulky clothes.

From around the propeller, she dug out a few branches,
a length of thick bungee cord,
and a columnar rubber fender, rope still attached.
Any of the above could have been a problem,
but it was the rope and rubber that had probably been making the worst noise.
“_People_ who drive along with these things hanging down!” she griped,
“They just get torn off.”

Inside, I was busy getting bacon, eggs, and home-fried potatoes ready for lunch.
Rhoda — now even colder and damper than before —
filled up the dish pan with warm water
to thaw out her hands.
I was trying to stay out of her way, but
“I need to get by to check on that bacon,” I said,
moments before the smoke detector started screaming.

Ventilator fans were turned on, windows were open,
and the smoke alarm (which didn't have any kind of hush button)
eventually shut off.
“It's funny how it didn't make a peep
when I had literal clouds of smoke blowing in from lighting the stove,”
I said,
“but browning the bacon sets it off.”

Rhoda, sitting down at last with her hands in warm water,
suggested we start the stove.
I'd picked up some easy-start composite fire logs
on one of the grocery runs,
and that's what she'd used to get things burning quickly yesterday.
So there shouldn't be any smoke and fuss this time:
just put the log in the oven, light the paper wrapper,
then add wood or coal once the fire is fully going.

Except, this time
the smoke detector decided it wasn't having any of our nonsense
and started screaming again as I was fussing with cheap matches.
But I'd lit one end of the log,
so I slammed the stove door shut and opened the windows again.

The fire lit, and I finished making lunch without any more difficulty.
But meanwhile, Rhoda had gone to the bow to find some more coal,
and started getting annoyed at how much of a mess
the storage compartments were.
I finally said, gently,
“Come eat your lunch while it's still hot. The rest can wait.”

At half past one, I headed out to the drizzle to get us moving again.
The drive towards Braunston was still pretty,
but not nearly as nice as doing the reverse route in the sunshine last week.

Of course, there were complications.
Approaching a bridge, I was a bit distracted
trying to figure out what three young people on the tow path
were doing, fussing with packages.
They were setting up for fishing,
but by the time I realized that,
I'd noticed a boat approaching the bridge from the other side.

There were moored up boats along my section of the canal,
but I thought I could fit in tight between the last one and the bridge
without blocking the oncoming boat.
However, as I start to steer over,
the people on the oncoming boat beckoned me to come through.
Or, at least, I thought that's what they were signalling.
Canal boat hand signals aren't exactly a standard language.

Anyways, I started towards the bridge, and so did they.
It _was_ wide enough for both boats, but only barely.
We coasted past inches from each other and from the edges.
The young anglers looked on skeptically.

“I hope this is the tightest scrape you face today,”
I joked to the other driver.
He didn't seem particularly amused.

A while later, another oncoming boat,
in a section with no bridges, but moored-up boats along one side.
I shift towards the stationary boats,
the other driver shifts towards the reeds.
Or that's what it seemed at first.
But then his boat starts swinging at an angle.
Was he trying to duck into an empty mooring spot before I passed by?
No, he was just stuck.

Since I still had room, I shifted over to the “wrong” side of the canal,
so that he would be able to move forward
even before he'd completely straightened out.
But then suddenly my boat started tilting sideways:
I'd run aground on a mud bank.

I backed up, he eventually pulled forward,
and we got past each other in the end.
But the fuss had got Rhoda's attention,
and she offered to take over for the last leg of our day.

I don't _think_ there were any more complications.
None enough for her to ask me to come up for help, anyway.
But as we passed by a set of double-parked working boats
that I remembered from the trip out of Braunston,
I realized it was almost 4pm and almost dark.
But we were almost there.
We moored up just before the turn into the village.
Alas, my cell network coverage was just as non-existent
as at our previous Braunston mooring point.

A few more minor complications for the evening:
I sliced halfway across my fingernail while chopping vegetables,
but a bandaid was enough to hold it together.
We spent a good 10 minutes trying to figure out
how to transfer files from Rhoda's tablet to my computer
when we don't have a central router to define a shared network.
(This _should_ be easy, people who define operating systems!)
But a USB thumb drive and a USB-C to USB-A dongle solved that.
My laptop went into emergency shutdown halfway through our movie
(not for the first time),
but checking all the plugs and adaptors got it to charge again.

Just as I went to bed, I remembered my weekly web standards teleconference,
and spent a little too long trying to figure out how to get a message out
saying that I didn't have enough phone service to call in.
If I held my phone _just_ right, I could get one bar of service quality,
enough for a text message if I'd only had someone's phone number on my device.
But as it turned out, today was Tuesday, the call is on Mondays,
and it had been cancelled, anyway.
(I just need to fix my email filters so
the agenda and cancellation notices would make it to my primary inbox!)

And of course, it was cold!
(The boat is really not winterized to Canadian standards.)
The coal stove couldn't keep up even when
we were both sitting in the room next to it.
But a few hours of the radiators made it toasty again.

All in all, not a _bad_ day.
Not a great day, either.
The kind of day you laugh about after it's over.

When I woke up in the middle of the night,
searching around for an ibuprofen tablet to ease my throbbing finger,
it took me a few minutes to recognize the song
that had got stuck in my head while I slept.

“Nothing lasts forever, not even cold November rain.”

Yes, subconcious, that's the song of the day, indeed.
