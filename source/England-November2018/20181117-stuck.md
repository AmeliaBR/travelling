The plan for Saturday was to leave Rugby and reach Coventry.
In between: a tiny tunnel at Newbold,
a few hours of countryside canals,
a single lock and a couple awkward turns separating the Oxford canal
(which we were on)
from the Coventry canal,
and then an hour or so driving towards the centre of the city,
maybe stopping at moorings a little further out.

At around 7:30am in the still dusky morning light,
another boat passed us by.
“Already! We were supposed to be the first ones out today,” said Rhoda.
I don't think she was serious.
We were both still in PJs, eating breakfast,
and fussing around with computer devices.

But we did get going before 9am.
Rhoda spent a few minutes digging around in the “weed hatch”
that gives access to the propeller.
She found not just weeds but also some elastic that had got tangled up.
But that's just routine maintenance.

The Newbold tunnel is less than 200m long,
not much longer than an expressway overpass.
But I was still worried when I saw an oncoming boat as I approached it.
I tried shifting over to my side,
but it would be very tight fit for two narrowboats to pass.

Luckily, the other boaters decided to play it safe
and wait for us in the open canal.
In addition to being narrow, the water in the tunnel was shallow,
and I had to back up and reposition myself in the center of the channel
to get any good forward momentum.

(Shallow water makes it difficult for the propeller to do its job.)
