My last day on the boat.
But no time for looking back:
I need to get the boat to the marina
and tidied up and ready for the next owners who will take it out.
Then I need to get myself to Gatwick,
where I've booked a hotel for the night before my flight home tomorrow.

I'm up fairly early,
take a few hours to do a mix of packing and cleaning.
I do a little more repair work on my leather jacket —
enough so I can take the pins out and wear it today.
My stomach's still a little queasy,
so I'm trying to pace myself with multiple small meals
from my remaining food supply.

Around 10am, I decide it's time to get moving.
The morning checks are routine, I untie and head off.
Past the next bridge,
I discover there _was_ plenty of public mooring available,
on the opposite side of the canal from the permit-only moorage
marked in my book.
But oh, well. The place I stayed had been nice and quiet.

Past the moored boats, the turn to the Northampton arm.
I start swinging the boat around,
and then pause for a moment, confused.
This looks more like a boatyard entrance than a canal branch.
It turned out to be both — a boatyard right at the corner —
but the moment of confusion was enough to make me miss the turn,
and have to back up and adjust.

The Gayton Marina is not very much farther up the arm,
but Rhoda had recommended that I pass it by
and continue to a turnaround spot (_winding hole_)
a little farther up.
The marina's services berth is on the main canal,
beyond the marina entrance,
so turning the boat around means that I don't have to back up later.
Also, turning before going to the services
means that the pump-out ports are on the side closest to the dock.
(Though the attendent later said this wasn't much of an issue.)

The canal as it passes by the marina is fairly wide —
or at least, it would be, if it weren't for all the boats tied up along it,
double and triple-parked.
The marina has a fleet of rental boats (hire boats, in British)
and when there's not much demand at this time of year,
they need somewhere to put them all!

As I slide through the narrow channel of open canal,
I scan the opposite bank to try to figure out where the services are.
There it is — one open section next to the pumps,
only slightly longer than my boat,
with tied-up boats three deep before and after it.
_That's_ going to be fun getting in and out of, I muttered to myself.

But for now, I passed it by.
Beyond the marina, the canal narrows and has a quiet countryside look.
The sun has come out, and it would be a lovely drive
if it weren't for my long to-do list weighing down on me.

I didn't bring my guidebook out with me,
but it's not supposed to be much further.
There are 17 locks between here and Northampton
(where the canal connects with a navigable section of the River Nene),
and the winding hole is just before the top one.
But there are thick bushes on either side of the canal,
and I cannot see how far ahead that might be.

Up ahead, there's a sharp bend to the right,
and on the opposite bank fences painted in the glossy black and white paint
used for locks themselves.
I look skeptically at the wide side of the corner, to my left.
That was definitely not big enough to turn my boat around.
Where was the winding hole?

It wasn't until I got right up to the corner,
beyond the thick hedgerows,
that I saw the winding hole —
like a pond scooped out of the canal bank —
on the left, immediately after the bend.
I start turning hard, but I should have stopped and backed up first
to get a better angle on it.

I end up stuck sideways, my nose jammed just beyond the whole,
where the canal narrows back into the entry way for the first lock.
It takes a few minutes of careful back-and-forth to get myself loose
and backed up into the main canal, to try again.
Thankfully, the winding hole is well maintained.
The banks have vertical metal reinforcing walls,
with thick rubber bumpers bolted to the metal.

It's called a _winding_ hole,
I've recently discovered,
not because you're twisting around tightly,
but because — if you do it correctly —
the wind helps blow your boat around.
I'm not sure whether I made any positive use of the wind as I turned,
but at least it wasn't blowing too hard against me, either.
Once I restarted from a good position,
clearly knowing the space I had to work with,
I was able to rotate the boat in a fairly smooth motion.

Then back down the arm to the marina.
I angle in to the service berth with less trouble than I'd expected,
jumping off once the stern end bumps against the dock,
and using the middle rope to pull the boat straight.
The wind is being more troublesome now,
pushing the boat away from the dock,
but I get it tied up, securely if not snugly,
with the back and middle ropes,
then go in to the office to fetch someone to help.

He fills up the diesel tank,
then gets to work on emptying the sewage ones.

I've glossed over it so far, but here's the basics of boat plumbing:
Clean water comes from free taps at various locations along the canals,
and is stored in a large tank in the front of the boat.
There's a separate hot water tank, as I've mentioned a few times.
Once you use the water for washing,
the drains in the sinks and the shower send it out into the canal.
In the case of the shower, there's a pump to make it work —
the drain in the bathtub is below water level.

Sewage, you will be relieved to know,
is _not_ dumped straight into the canal.
Toilets are either self-contained with an integrated holding tank
or are connected to a larger tank built into the boat.
In either case, “flushing” the toilet opens a trap door to the tank,
and maybe sprays a little bit of water in the bowl.
(I find that the gravity-based flush is fairly effective
at disposing of the most unpleasant material,
but wet paper does tend to cling to the bowl.)
A blue chemical mixture is added that helps break down the waste
while also limiting smells.

For the self-contained toilets,
you need to dump them out every few days
(depending on usage levels).
There are free service points along the canal system
where you can do this.
These are known as Elsan disposal points,
after the original brand of blue chemical,
and are marked by covered-bucket icons
which are unfortunately very close graphically to the trash-bin icons.

Built-in tanks have the benefit of being bigger,
so they don't need to be emptied so often.
But you need some mechanical help to do so,
and you'll pay £15­-20 per pump-out.
That's what I'm doing now.

There's a vertical pipe from each toilet tank
(we have two toilets on the boat)
up to the roof of the boat,
where it ends with a standard-sized opening.
The attendent attaches a nozzle to the opening and turns on vacuum suction.
A few minutes later, the tank is ready to use again —
_if_ you haven't flushed anything that clogs up the pipes.
Even quilted or multi-ply toilet paper is strongly discouraged.
A helpful sign on one of our toilets reminds people:
“Please do not throw anything in this toilet unless you've eaten it first!”

No clogs, no problems, today.
And I remembered to ask the attendent,
after emptying both sewage tanks,
to also pump out the swampy engine room with its broken bilge pump.
“Woah, that's a lot of water,” he comments before sucking it out.
I wonder whether the extra weight on our back end
was part of the reason we'd had such problems with shallow water and obstacles.

After closing up the hatches,
I head to the office to pay for the fuel, pump-outs,
and the sheets and towels we'd rented for our trip.
(Most boat share-owners bring their own,
but transatlantic luggage space is at a premium,
and this marina has linen supplies for their hire boats.)

I had the somewhat unusual experience of being asked
what price I wanted to pay for the diesel fuel —
or more specifically, which tax rate.
The diesel fuel supplied by marinas is colored with red dye
to mark that it isn't taxed for road use,
but there is still some tax applied for boat fuel.
However, fuel for heating and electricity generation is tax-exempt.
When you're running both functions from the same tank,
the accepted process is to declare a certain percentage of each fill-up to be tax exempt.

I had no idea what percentage of our fuel had been consumed by the heater,
let alone how much of the engine use goes to charge the batteries.
But a 60/40 split (60% for propulsion, 40% for electricity and heat)
seems to be the standard, so we went with that.

Bill settled, I went back to the boat.
I had a more difficult time getting it out of the service berth
than I'd had getting in.
My original plan was to back out at an angle
and then straighten out.
But once I got the stern past the third layer of moored up boats,
there wasn't enough canal left to adjust the angle —
not without risking smashing my rudder against that of the moored boat.
So I pulled in again, and tried the opposite approach,
angling my nose out first and then swinging the back around.

But of course, this was only the start of my fancy steering work.
I still needed to get into the marina and into the correct stall.
I'd remembered to ask at the office which stall that was,
but of course they weren't signed in any way you could read from the water.
But their numbering system was sensible enough
that I could count the existing boats and figure it out.

The stalls are arranged in angle-parking format,
and ideally the boat should be backed in to its stall,
but at least we were close to the end of the row
where there was room to turn around.
I had a couple light bumps against a boat in the next row
as I swung my nose around to the correct angle.
A man came out from the next boat in that row
and I readied an apology,
but he was just having a smoke and didn't seem at all irritated with me.

Tied up, I still had a few more services to take care of.
I plugged in to mainland electricity,
so that I could safely leave a small electric heater on
to help prevent frozen pipes during December.
And I needed to fill up the water tank.

But first, a break for lunch.
I also took the opportunity to call Rhoda in Toronto
to review my to-do list once more,
and just to check in.
(We'd texted back and forth,
so I knew she'd arrived home safe on Friday night,
but we hadn't talked more than that.)

The afternoon was spent cleaning.
As the water tank filled up,
I gave a quick once-over to the outside of the boat.
Rhoda had assured me that I wouldn't have to do a full outdoor clean:
on the frosty morning a few days back,
she'd written “Weather not conducive to outdoor cleaning”
on the log book for today.
The weather today wasn't quite so cold,
but I didn't have a lot of extra time.
So I cleared out the leaves gathered around the edges of everything,
and wiped the muddy rope-marks off the windows,
but skipped the full sponge and scrub
in favour of a rinse from the hose after I'd closed up the water tank.

Inside, I finished cleaning the bathrooms,
packed or stored everything as required,
cleaned the floors with that most retro of implements,
the carpet sweeper.
(For those not familiar, it's like a push vacuum without the vacuum part,
just rollers of bristles that flip dust and dirt away
as you push it over the carpet.)
I packed up as much food as I could bring with me for travel snacks,
then winced one last time and threw out the rest.
I washed the dishes and wiped down the kitchen,
packed up my last few things, and took stock.

It was 4:30pm, and I was almost ready to go.
My luggage was piled up in the dining area,
once I moved that out, and the trash and recycling,
I'd do a final wipe down of the kitchen floors,
take the waste to the bin,
take my paperwork and rental linens to the marina office
before it closed at 5,
turn everything off,
and be ready to go.

Time to call the taxi — it might take them a half hour to get here.

“Could I get a taxi to pick me up at the Gayton marina,
to take me to the Northampton rail station,”
I asked the operator.
_At 5pm_, I should have added, but didn't.
After confirming my location, 
“someone will be there in 15 minutes,” they said.
I froze. That was too soon!
But instead of requesting a different time,
I convinced myself I could do it.
That was probably a best-case time estimate, anyway.

Ok, no time for multiple trips.
Trash and luggage would both be moved out to stern deck,
close everything up, then take them over.
I could leave the paperwork and linens here,
that's what I was told to do if the marina had already closed when I left
and, well, close enough.
I remember just in time about my last few toiletries
still in the bathroom.
No time to actually brush my teeth as planned,
just grab everything and dump it into a bag and into my backpack.

Everything lifted up and out the door,
including my boots and jacket.
I grab the disposable cleaning cloth I've been using
and wipe down the floor behind me and the steps as I climb up them.
Reach down and start switching off all the circuits
in the DC electrical system, so the battery won't drain.
Only remember as the light extinguishes above my head
that I should probably turn off the normal light switches, too!
Out the door, lock it up,
toss the rag into the trash bag.
Put on my boots.

As I'm tying up my boots, my phone buzzes
with an automated message from the taxi company.
“Your driver is outside in a silver Prius.”
Later, I check the timestamp on the message:
_nine_ minutes after the end of my call with dispatch.
But for now, all I knew was: Dammit!

I move my new roller suitcase out onto the dock
(my original carry-on case is inside),
put my backpack on,
grab the reusable grocery bag with all my packed food in one hand,
and the trash and recycling bags in the other.

_Try_ to grab the trash and recyling bags in the other hand.
The plastic bag I'd use to hold glass and plastic bottles spills open.
Dammit!

I rearrange things.
I'm not even sure they have recycling bins here, let alone what categories.
I double check that automated message on my phone
to see if it gives me instructions to reply.
It doesn't.

I finally get everything gathered up successfully and start moving up the dock
towards the main marina building.
My phone buzzes again.
An actual phone call this time,
but I don't have a free hand to answer it.
I speed up, but the roller suitcase catches as I switch to a gravel path.

I leave the suitcase and my grocery bag there,
grab the trash bags and hurry forward,
asking a staff member who's locking up, where the bins are.
As I round the corner of the marina office building,
my phone starts ringing again,
but I'm able to see the silver Prius now and wave to the driver.

He hops out to help me with my bags,
but I explain that these bags are destined for the bin
and point him back towards my actual luggage.
At the dumpsters, I spot dedicated bins for glass,
so a few of my recyclables ended up there,
but the rest all gets tossed into the main trash bin
as I hurry back to my waiting taxi.

It wasn't until a few minutes later,
as I slowly catch my breath in the back seat of the taxi,
that I realize that I left the gas on.

Not on, as in burning and ready to explode, or anything like that.
But the line from the calor gas tank to the oven and range
was still open,
and I was supposed to have shut it off before I left.
But, no panick:
Rhoda's instruction notes had specifically considered this situation
and mentioned that, if I forgot to shut off either the gas or electrical systems,
I could contact the marina and they would send someone to shut things off.
I send her a text message from the train station,
and she offers to take care of the email.

Breathe.

It was fully dark by the time I got on the train to London,
no view out the window but my reflection,
but I spend the hour trip into the city starting at it anyway,
trying to let go of the feeling that I have too much to do
and not enough time to do it.

Yes, I still have to get myself and my baggage
up and down through train and subway stations
to make my connection to Gatwick.
And then I need to find the correct place for the shuttle to my hotel.
But all in due time.
And I still had plenty of time before the 9pm cut-off
for the hotel shuttle pick-up.

Breathe.
