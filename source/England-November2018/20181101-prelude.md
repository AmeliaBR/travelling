A few months ago, as I was making travel arrangements for this trip to England,
I searched out some photos from my last such trip, in April 2016.
I realized I had 700 photos from that trip, unsorted, unedited, unposted to anywhere but my backup drive.

Well, that's no fun.
How can I make my friends and family horribly jealous if I don't tell them all about my fabulous vacation?

In comparison, I've been enjoying keeping up with
[Louis Hoebregt's travel through Canada](https://canadaventure.tumblr.com) via his blog.
“Post as you go,” that's the key.
Don't wait until you get back home to a pile of work waiting for you.

Previously, I've used [Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/abellamyroyds/) to share photos and stories.
But with their recently announced restrictions on free plans,
and price increase for Pro plans,
I decided to try something different.
I am a web developer, after all.
Why not make a website?

I've also been meaning to see if Zach Leatherman's [eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) site-builder tool
is as convenient and flexible as he claims.
And I had wanted to look in to the recently-announced GitHub automatic deployment feature, too.

So that's what I'm doing.

I'm already four days in to the trip—and I want to keep posting as things happens—so I won't spend much time on config and styling up front.
Content first, then “progressive enhancement” to make it pretty!

Enjoy!
