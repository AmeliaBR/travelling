Returning to the canal from the garden gift shop at 3:45PM,
the November sky was already starting to darken,
the sun low to the Southwest.
It was clear that we would not make all seven locks in the Buckby set
before dark.
I offered to scout up ahead to see if there was room to moor (tie-up)
in between locks.

There were three locks I could see from where we were in Whilton.
The canal sections between them (aka, the _pounds_) were fairly generous.
A single boat moored neatly in the middle wouldn't block either lock.
But, it would make steering more difficult for boaters
who needed to temporarily moor up to get in and out to operate the locks.
We'd need to commit to getting up early and getting out of other boats' way.

However, as I was scouting I met a man working his way down the locks,
and asked him about moorage possibilities farther up.
He assured me that there was a decent stretch of open canal
after the third lock (from the top).
That would mean four locks from where we were at the bottom.

Looking at the dimming sky,
I didn't think we could get through even four locks by sunset.
But my captain decided to go for it,
so we did.

I headed back to help our fellow boater through the last lock in the series.
He was travelling on his own,
which means working the lock mechanisms on your own
as well as steering or pulling the boat in and out of the chambers.
In other words,
a lot of hopping in and out of the boat,
tieing and un-tieing it,
and sometimes clamboring over its roof to reach the ladder to climb out of the lock chamber.

The large lock
(designed for “broad” boats, twice the width of our narrowboats)
took its time to first fill (to the level of the upstream canal,so we could open the upper gate)
and then to empty again (down to the level of the lower canal, with his boat inside).

But at last we opened the bottom gate,
and he motored out (and immediately turned into the adjacent marina)
and Rhoda on the Cotonwood could drive right in.
I closed up the bottom gate,
then headed to the top and cranked open the sluices
(which allow the water in and out).

Only after I had it fully open did I glance back at Rhoda in the boat.
She was struggling to keep the boat from banging against the bottom gate
and the brick sides of the lock.

Ooops.

It's been two and a half years since I last worked a canal lock.
I forgot some of the protocol, clearly.
The lock had taken so long to finish filling up for the previous boat,
that I forgot how forceful the water is when you first fill an empty lock.

But once it was half full and filling at a more reasonable pace,
Rhoda suggested I go ahead to open up the next one for her.
She also travels alone at times,
and has no problem with the hop-on-hop-off routine
of working a lock and a boat simultaneously.

The second lock, although only emptied 10 minutes earlier,
was nearly half full when I got to it,
and needed to be emptied again.
The third lock was three-quarters full when I reached it.
The top gates were letting through steady streams of water
even with the sluices fully closed.

The bottom gates were just as leaky,
so that it was slow waiting for the chambers to fill
with water flowing out to counter the water coming in.
I'd only been opening sluices and gates on one side of the broad locks,
so that Rhoda could close them up again easily on her own,
but at one point she got tired of waiting
and climbed out of the lock (up the muddy center ladder)
to open the other sluice.

These locks are due to be closed for repairs in January and February,
and now we know why.

Sunset turned to dusk turned to complete darkness.
As we waited for the fourth lock to fill,
Rhoda joked that she hoped we didn't get a ticket for dangerous boating.

But the boat has a bright headlight,
and there was really no one else for us to bump in to,
and so we made it through the lock.
There was another boat already moored on the open stretch,
but room around the bend for us.

The spot —
with the M1 motorway on one side of the canal
and the express rail line from London to Birmingham on the other —
was not as quiet as it looked.
But with the moonlight illuminating spattering rain as we tied up the boot,
we were just glad to go inside where it was bright and warm.

It was 6pm.  Still too early for dinner.
(So I wrote this instead.)
