After two nights of being woken early by story weather,
it is probably not surprising that I slept in.
Rhoda was not in much of a hurry either,
so we didn't get outside until after 10am.
By that point, breaks were starting to appear in the clouds,
and it was flirting with being a nice day.

First stop was the Braunston marina to fill up with diesel again.
Rhoda took care of the backing into place.
Rather than dash off, though,
we decided that we really _had_ to try Braunston's other café.
Sure, the village café on the high street had been nice,
but the Gongoozler's Rest Café was an actual canal boat!

Permanently moored up outside the marina entrance,
the café boat was slightly shorter than ours,
with about 40% devoted to a large galley kitchen,
and the remainder featuring five two-person tables
on either side of a central corridor.

I'd had a decent breakfast already,
so I treated this more as a late-morning snack.
I ordered a flapjack,
which is a menu item Rhoda and I had commented on previously.
It is not a large pancake cooked over an open fire,
like the name suggests to North American ears.
Instead, it's a sort of soft homemade granola bar.
This particular version was tasty, if not terribly exciting.

I took a moment studying the drinks options.
I wanted something warm, because it was a chilly morning,
but not too sweet.
I saw the name Bovril
and my brain somehow made the association with Ovaltine
and other malted milk drinks, which sounded just right.

So I was rather suprised when the server brought out
a steaming mug of brown beef consommé,
made from Bovril beef stock powder.
When I explained my confusion,
she offered to swap it for something else,
but I told her to leave it:
a warm mug of broth was just what I didn't know I wanted.
(Although I did ask for a separate glass of water,
since the salty stock wasn't quenching my thirst very well.)

With both ourselves and the boat fueled up,
we departed Braunston for the second time.
But our route out was the slow one, via the six locks up to the tunnel.

This time, I was in charge of keeping the boat steady inside the large locks
as Rhoda worked the sluice paddles.

At the second lock, a family of three coming down the flight
pulled up and waited for us to fill the lock (with Cotonwood in it).
Their boat was barely half our size.
When I commented on it as I passed by,
the man at the tiller explained
“It's our first time, so we decided to stay with something easier to handle.”

The second lock has a canal-themed shop next to it,
and Rhoda popped inside while we were waiting for the water to fill.
I thought I'd need to work the next one by myself.
But just as I was lining up the boat against the shore,
Rhoda called out from the tow-path behind me,
waving me back towards the water.

“They had lots of stuff,” she said about the shop,
“including Braunston clotted cream fudge, which I _ignored_.”
(We had more than enough sweets on the boat.
But clotted cream fudge did sound interesting.)

A few locks farther on, we met another boat coming down.
The driver, travelling solo,
explained that he had waited a while at the top lock
because he'd thought there was another boat following him through the tunnel.
In these broad locks, two narrowboats going the same direction
can fit together side-by-side,
saving on work and on water as the locks fill and empty.

But the other boat not arriving,
he'd eventually taken the first lock by himself,
only to spot us coming up.
So he walked down to help us come up the locks a little faster,
and at the same time fill them with water for his boat to go down.

The boat that had been following him did show up
before we made it to the top lock ourselves.
As we passed them
(and they went to join the other boat heading down, for the rest of the flight)
the driver warned:
“Lots of leaves in the tunnel. Had to keep revving the engine.”

It was a little after noon now,
and the day had become quite sunny,
so we wished the best to the boaters who would enjoy that sun,
and headed into the darkness ourselves.

We were at least a quarter way through the 1.8km tunnel
before we encountered the fall leaves we'd been warned about.

I'm not sure how much of the impact comes from leaves sticking to the propeller,
and how much from the fact that they break up the smooth flow of the water
into turbulent whirls.
But either way:
in the already shallow, constrained water of the tunnel,
the thick layer of leaves made it feel like we were driving through sludge.
The sign at the front of the tunnel estimates travel time at 20 minutes.
I'm sure we were in there at least twice as long.

The moist, swampy tunnel air had seemed almost warm
when we first entered and were shielded from the outside breeze.
But the dampness turned to chill soon enough.
Once out the other end,
we moored up for a break inside with the heaters on.

I was still chilly a half hour later, holding my hands up to the radiator.
Rhoda, with her hands in a tub of warm dishwater,
suggested I could thaw out in a hot shower,
and she'd drive us the final hour to our destination for the day,
at the top of the Buckby locks.

The sun may have been bright for a while today,
but it never got very high in the sky,
and was disappearing again quickly.
We are, after all, only a month from winter solstice.
The warm autumn weather of our first week
had been a lucky fluke of chance and global warming.
We were back to typical November weather this week.
