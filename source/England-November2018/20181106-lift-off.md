Anyone who has ever travelled with me knows that I'm not the best at it.
I'm horrible at time estimating, and hate making commitments to be at particular places at particular times because I tend to run late.

So I was fairly proud of myself for having all my clothes packed the night before the trip.
Equally proud that I'd fit them all into a carry-on sized suitcase.
I'm also not known for travelling light.
But I didn't want to bring my giant suitcase with me,
and my only in-between sized one doesn't have wheels.

That said, I _only_ fit my clothes in that suitcase.
Oh, except for one full day's change, of course.
And my rain jacket and extra hat.
They went into the backpack with all the
toiletries, electronics, my laptop, portfolio of important documents,
my purse, and a bag of snacks for the travel.
When the backpack was finally packed up, it was nearly as large as the suitcase.
Hmmm… not sure this will fit the airline's “briefcase or personal item” sizing restrictions.

But it was too late to change now.

Morning of the trip was also focused on sorting out my apartment for three weeks without me.
Neighbours will be keeping an eye on it, of course,
but I don't want to come home to dead plants on the windowsill and growing green things in the fridge.

The plants are in the bathtub with a few inches of water,
and a lamp on a timer shining down on them.
I'll let you know in the end whether they turn into a swamp by the time I get back.

Perishables in the fridge were squeezed into my already-full freezer,
and what didn't fit was turned into lunch.
Egg scramble with sliced smoked meat and the last of the garden kale and tomatoes
(the former had picked just before a deep freeze blew in a few days earlier,
the latter had been slowly ripening on the counter for a month),
all served on couscous that had been cooked up with turkey stock.
Pretty good, if I do say so myself.

And then the last dishes were washed,
and the final check and double-check of the apartment was run,
and that heavily-packed backpack was swung into place,
and off I went to the light rail station only a few minutes later than planned.
(Go me!)

It was -10°C at half past noon,
with snow blowing over the frozen brown grass.
Not a bad time to be leaving town, even if not to a sunny tropical destination.

The train made the (once-an-hour) airport bus connection I was hoping for,
so no mad rush was required.
Picked up some pounds (of the British currency kind),
got my boarding pass from a machine,
and leaned over to extract my water bottle from my purse inside my backpack
so I could empty the bottle before security.

My mitts fell out of my pocket.
I was sweating in my warm scarf inside the building.
I went to stuff both scarf and mitts into my backpack, and realized I had absolutely no room.

Sigh…

Ok, Amelia, this is ridiculous.

I took the purse out of the backpack, and rearranged things to make room for my winter accessories.
Then I went back to the check-in machines and paid $30 to check my carry-on suitcase.
Good thing I always pack a day's change of clothes and other essentials in my backpack, right?

The fee hurt—fees always do—but I'd actually budgeted for it when I was comparing ticket prices,
so no harm done.
And moving around the airport was much easier with one fewer piece of luggage.

I lined up for security, and had a chuckle at some new signage
next to the warnings about sharp objects and large-serving liquids:

But I had no “only in Canada” tea leaves, nor overlooked pen knives
(let's face it, I don't own any more folding knives because they've all been confiscated at airport security).
Security was a breeze.
I had time to wander the shops on the other side.
A magazine and a donut were acquired.
The donut was demolished.
And then we were sent down to the tarmac for a final blast of Edmonton weather before the short flight to Calgary.

No photos; I didn't have much of a view, and the view quickly turned to endless clouds, anyway.
The weather was much the same at the Calgary airport,
but I didn't have much time to look around as I worked my way over to the international wing of the terminal.

I did get to ride YYC's fun new shuttle cars.
These are electric vehicles holding about eight passengers and a driver,
kind of like a van-sized golf cart.
They have drive through the hallways, separated from walkers by half-height barriers.
Flashing lights and computer-voiced warnings announce their passage at every intersection.

But most importantly, they saved me from huffing and puffing to get to the gate on time for my flight.

We were packed on board fairly efficiently, but had to wait for a few rounds of de-icing the wings,
then took what seemed like the longest possible taxi route to the farthest end of the airport before finally, finally, those big jet engines started to spin.

Lift off!

It was only 7pm Alberta time,
but I'd been up early and on the go all day,
so I was ready to start switching over to Greenwich time (7 hours ahead) and go straight to sleep.
But I'd pre-paid for dinner,
so I kept myself awake a little bit longer until that arrived
(it was entirely unremarkable)
before doing my best to get in a bit of sleep during the short night available to me.

Red-eye flights are never a delight.
If they were, they'd have a much nicer name,
like “lullaby flights” or “sweet dreams flights”.
But a lovely sunrise over puffy clouds is a nice thing to wake up to
(even if you were never deeply asleep in the first place).

A couple hours later,
approximately 9 hours after we took off from Calgary,
we had arrived at London Gatwick airport.

Holiday had begun.
