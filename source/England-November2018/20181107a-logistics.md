I've never been to Gatwick Airport before,
but all airports work pretty much the same:
you just follow the signs.

But while everyone else getting off the plane from Calgary
followed signs to customs and baggage claim,
I followed one to a washroom.

After an overnight flight,
I prefer to wash up, brush my hair, and put on clean underwear
before I stand in line for an hour to talk with a government official.

The restroom (and much of that wing of the terminal) was quiet,
so plenty of room and time to get to work convincing my body and mind that it was morning and not just the wrong side of night.

The only interruption was from an airport staffer coming in to tidy.
A male staffer, who announced himself with
“Ladies! There's a gentleman coming in. Is everyone decent?”
At that particular moment, I was, and was alone, so I shouted him in.
Based on his accent, I'm pretty sure he grew up next door to [Bruce Lawson](https://mobile.twitter.com/brucel/).
My accent, meanwhile, had clearly convinced him that I wasn't local,
so he ta-ta'ed off with an “Enjoy your va-cay!”

The slow wait for customs was, thankfully,
followed by a quick chat with the customs officer
and the first stamp on my recently-renewed passport.

Next on my to-do list:
find a UK SIM card so I could set myself up with affordable calling and Internet.
My mum (who travels to England twice a year) had told me to track down the WHSmith,
and indeed the one clerk at the shop was doing a brisk business selling SIM cards and phone plans to visitors.
(Folks who just wanted snacks and news were stuck either waiting or using the self-checkout tills.)

First problem occurred when I attempted to pay.
The keypad on the payment card machine wasn't working at all.
I was (and still am) a little concerned:
had someone messed around with the machine to steal people's PIN numbers?
But as we were passing things back and forth, trying to figure it out,
suddenly it beeped and the payment went through.
Oh, that's right, my new credit card has a contactless chip!
Good to know it works, and even overseas.

I trundled off to some nearby seats to insert the card into my phone
(glad to finally use the dual-SIM feature).
A couple reboots and everything seems to be working fine.
I get a text message from the phone company
telling me I'm all set up on the £15 30-day plan.
That's weird, I thought the combo I bought was based around a £10 plan
(plus SIM and activation and special one-time bonus data for international travellers buying at the airport).
But the clerk had mentioned it might take a few minutes for everything to be updated.

And it seemed to be working,
so I sent off a “this is my new number” text message to my mum back home.
Then I proceeded to try to get online to sort out evening's plans.

An hour and a half later, after multiple trips back to the clerk at WHSmith,
six different attempts to log in to the Gatwick Free Wi-Fi,
and phone calls, text messages, and website visits (on mobile data) to automated help systems for EE (the phone company) to try to sort out the phone plan,
I was about ready to cry.

The plan switch hadn't gone through,
that one text message had come out of my balance and now there wasn't enough funds on the account for even the plan I had paid for,
the bonus data wasn't valid without a plan,
and there was no way I could find to talk to a human being at EE who could help.
And the Gatwick Wi-Fi _still_ wasn't working.

I went back to the WHSmith clerk,
who had offered to refund the entire SIM+plan purchase if I couldn't sort it,
and that was that.
I didn't like any of the other package deals they had on offer
(they were primarily about calling instead of data),
but the clerk advised that one company he could sell me a SIM for £2,
which would give me a £2 pay-as-you-go credit,
and I could decide on plans and packages at my leisure.
**Sold!**

I thanked him, ran through the SIM card set-up once more,
texted my mum my _new_ UK number,
and reminded myself to actually eat something
(a slightly-stale pita that had travelled with me from home).
Then I made my way to the train station adjoining the airport.

But it took a few hours to escape the feeling that any moment
I might burst into tears of exhaustion and frustration.
