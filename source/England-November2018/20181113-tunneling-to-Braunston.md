Tuesday morning we finally got a look at our mooring place,
midway up the Buckby locks.
It did _look_ lovely,
with bushes along the canal masking the cars and trucks hurtling past.

But we weren't here to sight-see.
The plan was to finish the three remain locks of the Buckby seven before lunch,
and then continue on a few miles to the Braunston tunnel.
If we were making good time,
we'd go through the six locks in the Braunston flight
before reaching the village of Braunston proper by nightfall.

There have been mile markers along the canal,
and they are measured from Braunston,
so I can tell you exactly that this would be a little less than 16 miles
from where we started Sunday morning.

Rhoda decided to switch things up and have me drive the boat through the locks
while she worked the sluice paddles and gates.

I had a bit of a tough time pulling away from wall where we were moored up.
We're starting to think that there is something wrong with our gearshift.
A simple lever controls both the engine speed
and the forward/reverse transmission to the propeller.
There's supposed to be a bit of a catch as you switch
from forward to neutral to reverse.
But it wasn't catching very well,
and sometimes let you pull the lever to reverse while the gears were still in forward,
or vice versa.

Which is a bit of a problem when you're switching back and forth
while trying to ease out sideways from a wall.

But I got it working eventually,
and pulled into the empty lock above us,
which had been left open by a boat going down the night before.
Rhoda closed up behind me and opened the top paddles,
and we waited for it to fill.

And waited. And waited.

The bottom gates were desperately in need of replacement.
There was a gap of at least an inch between them along the lower half,
where water was spilling out even as it filled from above.
But it was starting to seem as if it would never reach full.

After a few minutes,
a woman with a windlass (the hand crank tools used to operate the locks)
came walking down from upstream.
As Rhoda explained about the slow, leaky locks,
she gave them a good look over.

Then she came down behind me
and closed a half-open sluice paddle on the bottom gate.
The boaters who had left the gate open had also left the sluice open,
and Rhoda hadn't noticed when she closed up.

Well, the lock started to fill up a bit faster after that.

We had a bit of trouble moving away from that lock,
partly due to our fidgety transmission
and partly due to the low water levels in the next pound.
(Buckby locks have an electric system pumping water from the bottom to the top,
but the in between levels depend on the usage and leakiness of the locks.)

But the next two locks were operated without too much trouble,
although the top one in the set was slow and leaky again.

At the top lock there was quite a crowd
enjoying the now sunny morning:
another boat headed down the locks,
two kayakers out for a paddle,
and a man walking a perky little Jack Russel terrier.
The dog trotted ahead across the lock gates
without any worries about the waterfall rushing to fill the lock below him.

Right above Buckby is a junction (fork in the canal).
The Leicester Line turns off to the North.
Rhoda took this route on her last trip in May,
but even if we wanted to retrace that path, we couldn't.
The canal is closed for repairs on the locks just shortly beyond the split.

So we took the left hand turn,
and continued on through a few miles of countryside.
The canal was fairly straight,
and the sun and the wind were fighting to see
whether the day would be warm or chilly.
A little past noon,
we moored up just ahead of the tunnel for lunch.

As Rhoda was still finishing up her meal,
I pushed off at 1:30pm and starting headed slowly
through the overhanging trees to the dark arch of the tunnel entrance.

The [Braunston tunnel]()
opened in 1793 as part of the Grand Union Canal
(what we've been travelling on)
connecting London to the upper Oxford canal
and to Birmingham and beyond —
without going up the sometimes tempestuous Thames River.
It is 1873m (2042 yards) long.
Which is quite a distance at canal-boat speeds,
but not the longest tunnel in the English canal system.

It is also not _quite_ straight.
It's almost straight —
you can see the light at one end from the other —
but there's a little wiggly bit where the connections from each end
don't quite connect up smoothly.
I was very glad not to meet up with any oncoming boats
as I navigated those undulating arches.

Seeing that light at the far end of the tunnel,
and nothing but blackness in between it and our headlamp,
makes it very difficult to judge distances.
I was rather suprised when Rhoda pointed out the distance sign
that said we were only 400m from where we entered.
More than 1400m (nearly a mile) still to go!

We did eventually pass a boat coming towards us
a few hundred metres from the end.
But Rhoda was steering at that point
(since I'd wanted to take photos)
so she had the responsibility of squeezing us tight against the wall.

On the other side of the tunnel we headed straight into the Braunston locks.
The tunnel was the literal high point of our day's journey:
we were now going downhill.

These locks, however, are not as steep as the ones at Buckby.
Six locks drop a total of 35 feet, 6 inches (10.8m) towards Braunston,
while the Buckby locks raised us a total of 62 feet, 10 inches (19.2m)
across seven locks.

(Yes, I know I'm switching units back and forth here.
The canal was built in the age of miles, yards, feet, and inches,
but newer signage is in metres and kilometres.
I'll try to always give the conversions.)

These locks were also in better shape than the ones at Buckby.
A few were still leaky, but some others had obviously been recently replaced.

Rhoda decided this was a good place for me to practice
the hop-on, hop-off routine of working a lock solo.
The locks were close enough that we could speed up the routine
by filling up the downstream lock as we waited for the upstream one to empty.
And then halfway through we crossed with another boat coming up,
so we had each prepped the remaining locks for the other.

All in all, we made good time,
and we came out of the bottom lock and into the village of Brauston proper
just as the sun started to slide towards the horizon.
Perfect timing,
since this is where we were planning to moor for the night.

We had a quiet evening on the boat,
leaving explorations of the village until morning.
As we calmed down from all the exercise on the locks,
I was surprised to discover that my cheeks were still flushed —
I'd gone and got a sun-burn!
