Rhoda had stopped in Weedon Bec on a previous trip,
and encouraged me to take advantage of our early stop to look around.

After the breezy, blustery day,
she was focused on getting a fire running.
We've mostly been using the very modern on-board radiators
which are powered by a diesel water heater.
But there's a tiny coal/wood stove
in between the kitchen and dining area.
It might not be very effective at heating the full length of the boat,
but it is very cozy if you're sitting right next to it.

So as she settled in for the evening,
I headed out to explore.
The neighbourhood I first passed through
was a very nice and boring late-twentieth-century housing developement.
Beyond the houses was Weedon Bec's claim to fame:
a very large army facility from the early nineteenth century.

The large red brick buildings are imposing,
if not very ornamental.
The central canal between them is no longer attached to the main waterway,
leaving a large portculis in the main building with nothing left to guard.
As I grabbed photos in the golden light of the setting sun,
the clock tower chimed out for 4:30pm.

Continuing on into the village centre,
I was surprised to hear electric blues guitar
streaming out into the street.
Peering through the windows of the pub beside me,
I confirmed that the sound emanated from a real, live musician
(and not just a stereo cranked loud).
After a quick stop in a convenience store
to pick up a newspaper for Rhoda,
I slipped into the bar and settled in with a pint of cider
to listen to the music —
for 15 minutes, anyway. He wrapped up at 5pm.

But the evening was not over.
Sunday, November 11, was of course also Remembrance Day,
and specifically the centenary of the armistice
that ended the conflict we now call the First World War.
Both Rhoda and I had been a little disappointed
that our schedule had us starting our holiday that morning
instead of attending any service or ceremony.

But on my walk through the village,
I'd passed a poster about the local remembrance ceremonies,
and was surprised but glad to see evening events included.
So I phoned up Rhoda and she let her little fire die down
and came to meet me at the pub.

We weren't sure quite what to expect.
The poster said to “meet at the Scout Hut” at 6:30pm,
after which there would be a Last Post ceremony
and lighting of a beacon.

The bartender assured me that the Scout Hut
was only a few blocks up the street
and would be unmistakable when we got there:
“It's, well, a hut,” she said.
I still managed to misunderstand the directions
and started us walking up the wrong street from the intersection.
But after passing multiple groups walking in the opposite direction,
we stopped to ask & got ourselves sorted out.

The Hut, it turned out, was actually a large prefab building.
There were people gathering inside and out.
We stuck with the outside crowd,
many of whom were combining the evening events
with their evening dog-walk.

Volunteers regularly popped out to tell us there were refreshments inside,
including one man dressed in a red and gold town crier uniform
complete with tri-corner hat and clanging hand bell.
One woman eventually brought some snacks outside,
so I got to discover that a “Tannock's TeaCake”
is just British for marshmallow puff cookie.

At 7pm, the town crier came out again and urged us all to gather round.
He introduced the local pastor,
who gave a short but pointed speech
urging us to remember not only those who died in war,
but also those whose pain lasted a lifetime afterwards.
Then a piper (of the brass kind) played Last Post,
and after the moment of silence and Reveille, the main attraction:
the lighting of the beacon.

The beacon was a large bonfire, neatly contained in a steel frame.
I'm not sure which group was organizing it,
but the Weedon Bec beacon was apparently one of many thousand
being lit in villages and towns across the UK at the same time.
As the flames rose,
another piper (of the Scottish bagpipe kind) started playing.

After the bagpiper finished,
the music was taken up by the bells of the village church.
We couldn't see the church from where we were,
but the sound of the bells echoed throughout the village
and continued as everyone dispersed and walked home.
Their tune was celebratory, not mournful,
reflecting the anniversary of the day the bells rang out
to celebrate the end of The Great War.
