Wednesday morning I awoke unceremoniously by falling out of bed.
Or more to the point,
the bed fell out of bed.
Myself, mattress, and bedding all ended up on the floor.

The bed I'm sleeping on is designed as a sofa bench during the day.
There are two parallel benches on opposite sides of the boat,
and you can put boards across the middle to create a king-size bed.
With only me that seemed excessive,
so I was making due with a single bench.
But it is very narrow.
The mattress cushion is also very thin,
and I'd compensated by doubling it up with the back cushion,
but they aren't quite the same width
and I'd re-arranged things a couple times already
and this arrangement was clearly not a keeper.

Also, the boat seems to be particularly tilted today. It happens.
Bumps and knocks in marinas and locks,
and the ballast weights under the floor shift out of position.

We're in Braunston,
a village that is important to the canal network
(as the junction of the Grand Union and Oxford canals)
but not particularly notable to anyone else.

For our purposes,
the most interesting feature is the washing machine icon
associated with the large Braunston marina
in one of our guide books.
I've been on holiday a full week now,
and rain and mud and sweat have taken their toll on my clean laundry supply.

After breakfast we headed to the marina shop
to confirm that yes, indeed, there was a small laundrette
(that's British for laundromat)
and passing boaters could use it.
So that was our plans for the afternoon.
We purchased tokens for the machines
(£10 for a full-load wash and dry! Yowzer!),
and then crossed the canal to explore the village.

Rhoda made use of her new folding walking stick
(purchased two days ago in Whilton)
to get up the steep footpath to the aptly-named village High Street,
and also appreciated a bench thoughtfully located halfway up the hill.
I took the extra time to get a closer look at
the grand church at one end of the street,
and to enjoy the view from the hill at the countryside we'd be travelling tomorrow.

A message on my phone let me know that
Rhoda had made it to the shops and was wondering where I'd got to.
It was only later that I realized that was itself notable —
I hadn't been able to get any cell signal at all
from canal level.
But I didn't think about it at the time,
so I didn't spend our stop at the village café checking email and Twitter
like a proper millennial.

Of course we stopped in the café.
Some canal boaters make a point of checking out all the canalside pubs
on their route.
Rhoda checks out all the village cafés.

After the coffee, tea, and cake were done,
we split up to gather a few groceries:
I went to the butcher next door,
and Rhoda to the general store across the way.
Thanks to a miscommunication, we both bought eggs.
Good thing we still have more than a week to eat them up.

The posters (and guide-book descriptions) for the Braunston butcher
had all mentioned their famous meat pies.
Rhoda had asked me to please not buy steak-and-kidney,
but that only narrowed down the options slightly.
I ended up picking out a steak and _stilton_ (cheese) pie.

“Have you tried it before?” asked the counter attendant
as she reached for the pastry.
I paused. Was it, like kidneys, a flavour not for everyone's taste?
But she explained that she was asking out of curiousity —
she'd not yet tried it herself.

Well, it might not be to everyone's taste,
but I liked it.
Stilton is the type of strong cheese that I don't always like,
but its flavour melded nicely with the steak and gravy.

(You'll have to ask me later about
the wild boar sausages with apple and leek,
which were the other unusual item bought from the butcher.)

After lunch, it was time to dress up
for the afternoon's main event.
All my jeans and warm trousers went into the laundry bag,
so I was wearing nylons and a smart skirt
as I stepped over the muddy paths and bridges,
past various boatyard work sheds,
to the marina laundry room.

I did have one pair of clean jeans left,
but they weren't quite ready to wear:
I'd bought them at an extreme discount a couple weeks ago,
but the legs needed shortening and the pockets needed lengthening.
So that's what I was working on
as I waited for my clothes to wash and dry.
I'm sure I looked a little out of place,
sitting and sewing in my smart city outfit,
while boaters pulled up beside me to pump out their sewage tanks.

Back in the boat late afternoon,
it was just a little bit chilly.
I went to turn on the hot water heater that powers the radiators
(the _calorifier_ in canal boat terms),
then thought better of it.
Tonight would be a great night for a fire in the stove.

Rhoda was still at the laundry room,
but I found and installed the chimney stack
(detachable so it doesn't get caught on low bridges or other obstacles).
Then I gathered my wood and set about building the fire.

It's been a while since I've lit a wood fire,
but I don't think the process has changed much.
We by now had a good supply of paper waste ready to use as kindling,
so I expected it to be fairly easy.
However, I've never lit a fire in such a tiny stove —
less than a cubic foot on the inside.

I'd light a bit of cardboard or twisted newspaper,
fan the flames, blow at them,
but try as I did all I got was smoke billowing out at me
and fading embers in the stove.
I double-checked for any flue or valve
that I'd overlooked and need to open,
but as far as I could tell there was clear air supply and an open chimney.

After about 15 minutes of fussing,
I gave up, closed the stove door,
turned on the radiators,
and went to wash the soot off my hands and my cardigan.
Maybe Rhoda would know the secret.

A few minutes later,
coming back through the boat closing curtains against the dark,
I was surprised by a bright, crackling fire in the little stove.
Apparently, the secret was closing the door.

Rhoda arrived at that point,
and asked why I had the wood stove and the diesel heater running at the same time.
It wasn't intentional.
But I'm glad we have options!
