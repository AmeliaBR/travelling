Waking up in Weedon Bec,
our first task of the day was a quick grocery shop
to pick up a few things we realized we were missing,
as well as some bottled water.

The boat has full plumbing,
and the water is technically potable,
but it's water from a public tap
which sits around for a few weeks
in a tank which only gets cleaned once a year.
So bottled water is nice indulgence —
but one we didn't want to lug back to the marina
on the half-hour walk from the bus stop in Milton Malsor.

In contrast, our mooring spot at Weedon Bec
had been intentionally chosen to be close to a shop.
Our entire journey is planned with the help of canal guides
that identify canal-adjacent services, shops, and pubs.

The Canal and River Trust has online interactive maps for each canal,
but out in the countryside we rely on paper books,
cross-referencing the descriptions in guides from two publishers.
(J.M. Pearson & Son's very chatty and opinionated <cite>Canal Companion</cite> series,
versus the more pragmatic <cite>Nicholson Guide to the Waterways</cite>.)

Those same guides advised us of a garden centre and tea room
a few miles ahead.
More modern technology confirmed
that they were open on Mondays even in the off-season —
and that, in fact, they were gearing up for a secondary season
as a seasonal “winter wonderland”
with ice skating and appearances by Santa Claus.

(We later discovered that the ice rinks were located
in empty greenhouses,
but goodness if I know how they keep the ice cold enough for good
skating when temperatures only go down to around 8°C at night.)

The Whilton garden centre was also conveniently located
near the base of the Buckby locks.
In most English canals, locks —
the gated chambers that raise and lower boats to canal sections at different heights —
are operated by boaters themselves.

The Buckby locks are a set of seven,
named after the town of Long Buckby a mile or so east of the canal.
Altogether it would be a few hours' work,
so we moored up first at the base for lunch and then our excursion to the shop.

Although there weren't many plants for sale in November,
the garden shop was quite large,
combining the practical with cute and kitschy.
Both of us found a few things to buy and much more to look at.
I spent quite a few minutes chatting with the critters
in the pet store section at the back.
I might have overlooked the animals altogether
except for a chatty chicken named Bernise who,
according to her sign, was “on holiday”.
There were also a pair of long-eared rabbits
who were marked as boarding at the shop temporarily,
and one absolutely enormous bunny
who apparently is a star attraction at “cuddle parties” held by the shop.

But there were also critters for sale,
including a wide variety of birds I just had to photograph
for certain bird-loving friends,
and a couple of curious ferrets.
